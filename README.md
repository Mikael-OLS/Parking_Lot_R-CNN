# Detecting Free Parking Spots Through a R-CNN

Finding a parking space in a crowded lot can be a really tough and irritating challenge. 
It is of both the owner of the parking lot and the visitors interest to streamline the process of finding free parking spots. 
However, many of the solutions requires a lot of eqiupment, such as sensors on each parking space. But what if one solution only requires a simple camera and some machine learning? 

This is aim of this project - to identify free parking spots through a videoclip. For this project to be concidered a success, it needs to identify the vast majority right and fairly quick.
